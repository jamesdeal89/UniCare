# Requirements

These requirements are based on the brief provided by BAC-IN and the further discssions we had with them during the pitch. 

__If we are no longer able to work with BAC-IN, these requirements might change as the product will become more broad and less specific to BAC-IN's 'lived experience' approach to recovery.__

## Textual Analysis

_Highlighting key:_

- _Purple_ text means non-functional requirement.
- _Yellow_ means use-case.
- _Blue_ mean an actor.
