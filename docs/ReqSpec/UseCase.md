# Use Case Diagram

![Default Use Case](reqs_specs_assets/UseCaseDiagram.png)
*Figure 1*

The Use Case Diagram in Figure 1 displays the use cases we identified for the app. The app is mostly self contained, with most uses happening directly between the user and app. The only use case where  external services are required is during crisis reporting where the chatbot recognises that the user may need more professional help.

*Figure 2*

The Use Case Diagram in Figure 2 displays the updated use cases, which more accurately represent the final state of the app we wish for. We have kept most of the original features, however we are now implemetning a journalling feature instead of mentoring due to the inherent advantages of journalling towards mental health, and a lack of consistent mentors to readily be available for users. We decided that the app should be self sufficient in it's support of the user and these features were the ideal way for us to support a potential user in need.
