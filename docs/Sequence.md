*Figure 1*

The default use case shown in Figure 1 shows how the app will allow the user to first log in, then navigate the menu and talk to the chatbot. The chatbot will hold the conversation until the user leaves, and it will remember the details of the conversation until the next use.

Figure 2 shows the use case of a user updating their profile. The user will log in then navigate the dashboard to a profile updating menu. Here they can update their login or details and the chatbot will take note of updates to nicknames.

*Figure 4*

Figure 3 displays the use case for crisis reporting. If the chatbot feels that the user is in a dire situation, then it will prompt the user to reach out to external services. If the user accepts, then the user will be referred to external health services. However, as shown in Figure 4, if the user refuses, the chatbot will aim to comfort the user as best they can.
