# Use Case Diagram

*Figure 1*

The Use Case Diagram in Figure 1 displays the use cases we identified for the app. The app is mostly self contained, with most uses happening directly between the user and app. The only use case where  external services are required is during crisis reporting where the chatbot recognises that the user may need more professional help.
