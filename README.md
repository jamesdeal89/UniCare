# Team 31 - Bac-In Recovery Chatbot
## COMP2002, Group Project - Team 31

Our project is based on BAC-IN's brief to create a Recovery Chatbot in order to give people struggling with addiction an AI assistant they can talk to if they don't want to immediately seek proffessional human help; idea being that someone may feel more comfortable to make the 'first step' towards recovery via an inanimate chatbot.

Recently, we faced issues in communications with BAC-IN and later learned our project co-ordinator on their end was sadly made redundant. This affected our development of the project severely; nonetheless we are working closely with our academic supervisor to continue with BAC-IN in some capacity, or contine 'in-house' with the medical department.
