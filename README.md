## COMP2002, Group Project - Team 31

Our project is based on BAC-IN's brief to create a Recovery Chatbot in order to give people struggling with addiction an AI assistant they can talk to if they don't want to immediately seek proffessional human help; idea being that someone may feel more comfortable to make the 'first step' towards recovery via an inanimate chatbot.

During early development, we faced issues in communications with BAC-IN and later learned our industry supervisor was sadly made redundant. This affected our initial development of the project.

Nonetheless we worked closely with our academic supervisor to see if we could continue with BAC-IN in some capacity, or contine 'in-house' with the medical department. We ended up coming to the decision that an in-house project that leant more towards catering for student's wellbeing would be ideal. We decided on **UniCare** - an iOS and Android app designed to target welfare while maintaining the original chatbot function.
